# Website-Project

This is a website inspired by one of my favorite YouTube channels, "Dead Meat", specifically by their on-going series "Kill Count".
It includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and it can be run on a Python server with the command `python3 -m http.server`.

This project was made for the university computer science course "Web Technologies" of the University of Bucharest.
