				<h2>What is the Kill Count?</h2>

				<p>
					The Kill Count is a site that specializes in horror movie statistics, more exactly, in how many characters die during the span of the movie. While not all horror movies contain scenes or plot-lines where characters die, it is certain that that kills and the overall subject of death is one of the most common elements found in horror movies.
				</p>

				<p>
					The kills are not a metric for how good, gory or scary a horror movie is, but the manner in which they are presented can affect how corny the film is or be a good indicator of the film's budget and/or age ratings.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				What the Kill Count basically does is analyze (not necesarily in depth) these kills and make certain statistics about them, like how many characters were killed, their gender and sometimes even species. Additionally, the Kill Count also takes in account how a kill was executed, it's goriness, creativity, relevance to the plot and it's overall execution.

				<h2>Why the Kill Count?</h2>

				<p>
					The Kill Count is a school project born out of my personal passion of horror movies. The site is inspired by a real-life youtube channel created by James A (more details in the inspo page). Janisse. While not a life-long fan, in the last few years I've grown to really enjoy the genre and many of it's sub-genres and themes, especially because of James's videos. My horror movie tastes range anywhere from classic slashers and deep psychological thrillers to goofy 80's and early 2000's horror-comedies.
				</p>

				<p>
					I like to belive that The Kill Count is not only a way for me to portray my interest, but also a way for me to improve and work on both my front-end and back-end webdesign skills and apply what I learned in my Web Tehnologies course.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I am not a professional web designer and I don't expect my site to reflect that, but I do hope that through enough effort and determination The Kill Count can become something that I feel proud of and have fun creating.

				<h2>How is a kill counted?</h2>

				<p>
					There has been a certain debate amongs fans of the original Kill Count about what qualifies as a kill since zombies, ghouls, vampires and overall horror movie logic and fantasy creatures tend to blur the lines between life and death.
				</p>

				<p>
					While kills can drastically vary on how they are portrayed, the main factors to what qualifies as a kill are if the kill was shown on-screen, if was verified to have been a kill by the movie (i.e the villain waking up in the last few seconds of the movie makes it not count as a kill) and the species of the victim (i.e a dead ficus doesn"t count).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Of course, there are certain special cases like the person changing species, or a accident that involved a lot of people. A good rule of thumb is to follow the logic of the horror movie and the relevance of the kill, for example someone who died as a zombie counts twice if their zombie transformation was shown on-screen since the transformation implies that their old-self died. When the movie doesn't give a specific number of how many people died during an accident/mass murder (shown on-screen), The Kill Count only counts how many people appeared on-screen or gives a rough estimation if things weren't clear.
