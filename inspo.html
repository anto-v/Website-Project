			<h2>
				Who is James A. Janisse and why do I keep mentioning him?
			</h2>

			<p>
				James Anthony Janisse is the founder and host of the YouTube channel Dead Meat, the youtube channel I'm an avid fan of and got inspired by. On Dead Meat, his most popular and frequent show is The Kill Count, where he counts the kills of horror movies, such as Friday the 13th, Scream, Child's Play, and many other horror movie series and other smaller films, and TV-shows like Stranger Things. He has also worked as an editor and even acted in movies and shows as background characters. His work includes being a writer for TMI Hollywood, editor for Powerhour, and camera and electrical department for The Midnight Hour. His acting jobs include Scream (2022), The Look-See Season 2, Powerhour, Hashtag, So far from God, Talons, Once upon a University, and some other shorts. He is also the host of Create A Killer and What's Your Favorite Scary Movie.
			</p>

			<p>
				All in all he is <b>THE</b> horror movie guy, and the reason I got so hooked on horror movies. I love how he presents with wit, humor and a certain sensibility, aknowledging the more problematic tropes and gags of horror movies. While I am a bit of a scaredy cat and jumpy when it comes to horror movies, his commentary really helped me appreciate horror movies in a more digestible way.

			<p>
				The main series of Dead Meat is The Kill Count. A weekly episode of a horror movie (sometimes even a TV Show, Video Games, Music Videos, Musicals, or Comics) and counting all the kills in it, normally released on Friday and sometimes Sunday.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Kill Count is a venture into the world of horror to discover the lives taken throughout centuries of horror films with information about production. and a whole lotta jokes. It all started when James made a website similar to the show now ( again, pls don't copyright me for this site ), where he counts all the kills from a movie.
			</p>

			<p>
				As of now <a id="chnl" href="https://youtube.com/@deadmeat?si=Eg46lsZJeprSjYB-">Dead Meat</a> has 6,390,000 subscribers, me included. Dead Meat got started in 2017, so having been watching the channel since 2018 I feel like a veteran.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, I'm not the only avid fan of this channel, there are plenty of other, in fact, there are so many that there is a fan wiki for the channel:
